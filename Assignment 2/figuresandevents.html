            <h1>Celebrities of the Yeehaw Agenda</h1>
            Significant figures who helped popularize the aesthetic in 2018 include celebrities like Kelela, Solange, Ciara, and breakout stars like Lizzo, Megan Thee Stallion, and Lil Nas X who had key fashion moments that inspired the cowboy chic. Lil Nas X in particular has been instrumental in reinvigorating conversations about the role race plays in the mainstream perception of country music and its aligning fashion. Progressive country artists like Maren Morris, Kacey Musgraves, and Mason Ramsey pushed country music into the mainstream redefining what it means to be a country music fan.
