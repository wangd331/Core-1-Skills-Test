        <h1>Hi there! My name is Deanna and I have severe high-frequency hearing loss.</h1>
        <p>In speech, it is difficult for me to hear soft sounds and consonants like c, ch, s, sh, ff. <br><br> As a child, playing the game Telephone was a clumsy and frustrating experience. I had no idea that my complete lack of skill in the game was due to my impairment! My hearing loss to high-frequencies made it impossible to decipher whispers. <br><br> This site is a comical take on a part of my everyday experience. I hope you enjoy!</p>
