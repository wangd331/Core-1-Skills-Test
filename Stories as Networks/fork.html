        <span class="text">In ten minutes I had developed my plan. The telephone directory gave me the name of the one person capable of passing on the information.</span>
        <a href="visit.html">He lived in a suburb of Fenton, less than half an hour away by train.</a><br><br>
        <span class="text">I am a timorous man.</span>
        <a href="mission.html">I can say it now, now that I have brought my incredibly risky plan to an end.</a>
        <span class="text">It was not easy to bring about, and I know that its execution was terrible. I did not do it for Germany - no! Such a barbarous country is of no importance to me, particularly since it had degraded me by making me become a spy.</span>
        <a href="visit.html">Furthermore, I knew an Englishman - a modest man - who, for me, is as great as Goethe.</a>
        <span class="text">I did not speak with him for more than an hour, but during that time, he was Goethe.<br><br>I carried out my plan because I felt the Chief had some fear of those of my race, of those uncountable forebears whose culmination lies in me.</span>
        <a href="mission.html">I wished to prove to him that a yellow man could save his armies.</a> <a href="escape.html">Besides, I had to escape the Captain.</a> 
        <span class="text">His hands and voice could, at any moment, knock and beckon at my door.<br><br>
            Silently, I dressed, took leave of myself in the mirror, went down the stairs, sneaked a look at the quiet street, and went out. The station was not far from my house, but I thought it more prudent to take a cab.</span>
            <a href="escape.html">I told myself that I thus ran less chance of being recognized.</a> 
            <span class="text">The truth is that, in the deserted street, I felt infinitely visible and vulnerable. I recall that I told the driver to stop short of the main entrance. I got out with a painful and deliberate slowness.</span>
